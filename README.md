**vi-press** is an deprected wordpress plugin for deploying basic video-based CSCL scripts.

The plugin depends on **[vi-two](https://github.com/nise/vi-two)** for realizing interactive videos in general and video annotation in perticular.

The development of video-based scripts has been continued in a node.js application called **[vi-lab](https://github.com/nise/vi-lab)**.
